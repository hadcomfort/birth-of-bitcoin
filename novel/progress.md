# Progress Report

## Narrative Elements Complete

- Initial conceptualization of Bitcoin's origins.
- Development of Satoshi Nakamoto's character motivations and initial intellectual journey.
- Establishment of the historical and philosophical context (cypherpunk ideals, post-2008 financial crisis).

## What's Left to Write

- Detailed technical explanations of Bitcoin's mechanisms (Proof-of-Work, blockchain, cryptography).
- The narrative arc of Bitcoin's launch and early community interactions.
- Satoshi's eventual withdrawal and the implications for the project's decentralization.
- Climax and denouement of the novel.

## Current Status of the Manuscript

- **Phase:** Early drafting phase.
- **Estimated Pages:** Approximately 10-15 pages complete (conceptual and foundational material).

## Known Plot Holes or Inconsistencies to Address

- Ensuring a smooth transition from conceptual ideas to technical implementation without losing narrative flow.
- Developing secondary characters or interactions to provide more dynamic dialogue and external conflict.

## Evolution of Narrative Decisions and Stylistic Choices

- Leaning into a more introspective narrative for Satoshi, focusing on their internal thought processes and intellectual struggles.
- Prioritizing clarity and accessibility for technical explanations, potentially using analogies or simplified examples.
