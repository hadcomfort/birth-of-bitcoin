# World Setting

## Temporal Setting

Late 2000s, specifically the period immediately following the 2008 global financial crisis. This era is characterized by widespread distrust in traditional financial institutions and a growing interest in alternative economic models.

## Physical Environment

- **Satoshi's Workspace:** A minimalist, highly secure digital environment. Could be a home office, a secluded study, or even a purely virtual space, emphasizing the digital nature of their work. Focus on the quiet intensity and isolation of deep technical creation.
- **Online Forums and Mailing Lists:** The primary social and intellectual battleground. These digital spaces are vibrant with debate, collaboration, and the exchange of radical ideas among cypherpunks and cryptographers.

## Intellectual and Philosophical Landscape

- **Cypherpunk Ideals:** A strong emphasis on privacy, cryptography, and decentralization as tools for social and political change. Belief in the power of code to enforce rules and protect individual liberties.
- **Distrust of Institutions:** A pervasive skepticism towards central banks, governments, and large corporations, fueled by financial crises, surveillance concerns, and perceived corruption.
- **Libertarian and Anarcho-Capitalist Undercurrents:** While not universally shared, these philosophies provide a backdrop for the desire for self-sovereignty and freedom from state control.

## Atmospheric and Sensory Details

- **Atmosphere:** A sense of quiet revolution brewing in the digital underground. The hum of servers, the glow of screens in darkened rooms, the rapid-fire exchange of ideas in online text.
- **Sensory:** The abstract beauty of cryptographic algorithms, the tension of economic uncertainty, the intellectual thrill of solving complex problems.
